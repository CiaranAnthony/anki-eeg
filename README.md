Using EEG data, we train a classifier to determine whether the brain is in a good or bad state for learning

The inspiration for this project was from the paper: [Improving Memory Performance Using a Wearable BCI](http://doi.org/10.3217/978-3-85125-467-9-128). 

Word list and word features was randomly  generated from the [Paivio et al. Word List Generator](http://www.datavis.ca/online/paivio/).
